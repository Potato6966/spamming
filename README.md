## Installation Issues
Fortnite may crash on installation unless you're using TrollStore or a paid certificate from FlekStore or other certificate provider. Due to an Apple limitation that cannot be bypassed.

If your download progress jumps from different percentages restart Fortnite and don't do anything, don't quit the game. Just wait
