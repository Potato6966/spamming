# EGS IPA repository

Celestial has partnered with Signulous and because of that they will be releasing ipa files after a few days. Signulous costs 20$, so I will post my non-modified and modified ipa's by me in this repository after the update releases.

# Fortnite

## Installation Issues
Fortnite may crash on installation unless you're using TrollStore or a paid developer certificate. Due to an Apple limitation that cannot be bypassed.

## How to Install with an Apple Developer Certificate
If you have a MapleSign, Signulous certificate, or TrollStore, you should be able to install the IPA directly.

For users with their own paid certificate:
1. Enable the following entitlements (otherwise it will crash):
   - **Extended Virtual Addressing**
   - **Increased Memory Limit**
2. Sign the IPA with your certificate using your preferred signing method.

# Fall Guys

## How to Install
Unlike Fortnite, Fall Guys doesn't require special entitlements to play. You can use [ESign](https://www.stabbed.lol/esign/ESignV5.0_noLogs_V1.1.ipa) with any certificate or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) without a certificate. The latest update works with any signing method without crashing.
